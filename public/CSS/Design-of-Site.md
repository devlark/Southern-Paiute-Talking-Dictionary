# Status as of 6/24/21

Attached are the first designs I have for the webpage. They are based on the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah's page, with the same color theme and footer. I am not sure that this is ok, however, since this project is owned by the Cedar Band of Paiutes and not the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah as a whole. I intend on showing the designs to the founder of the project, a member of the Cedar Band, and see what he thinks. I will likely have to change it, but I think it will largely stay the same besides a different footer and color theme. 

All designs thus far are done with Figma.

## Home Page

![Home Page](Images/Homepage.png)

I am doing my best to keep this page simple. It has the various other pages in the navigation bar, the search bar, logo of the Cedar Band of Paiutes, and the footer (with all the logos of the bands comprising the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah).

## About Page

Note that most of the names here are redacted until I receive the ok from the members of the team to release them. 

This page is up in the air in terms of details. I would like to insert a picture of the team or the elder at work, but as of right now do not have one. Instead, I have a juniper tree, a tree native to Utah and Cedar City. The blurb is also prone to change. Additionally, I have blank gray  circles in which to insert photos of each team member. I will insert them once the design is okayed and I receive them from each member. 

## Contact Page

This page is based on a design I found in Dribbble. I attach the team email to the form just in case the user doesn't want to use the form for whatever reason. The email is blanked out for privacy purposes, at least for now. 

## Search Results Page

![Search Page](Images/SearchPage.png)

This page will pull results from the database and show them to the user. All terms will link to a detailed word page. 

## Word page:

This page is an example of what a specific term, be it word, sentence, or phrase, would look like. 

## Additional Thoughts

You will notice that there is a page in the navigation bar that is not listed here: Paiute Spelling. We have not yet decided on an alphabet, so spelling is still tentative. On this page, however, I hope to go through each letter and how they feature in some words. There are some other pages I have envisioned, but not included yet, such as a Lessons page, and a Resources page. These will come as we develop curriculum and amass resources. I am also open to further pages as the site becomes more developed, however, the pages included here are what I deem most important and thus come first.
