/*
The compiler will now automatically create a 
homePage.css inside public/css

So then you could just link homePage.css in to the
homePage html etc

Comment out imports, add them, whatever :D

But I stress this is a bit messy lol

Easier to have one style.scss

I think the general practice is that it's preferred
to have one single large minimized CSS over linking
multiple CSS files...minimized would mean it could
be read quickly by the browser, and the browser will
cache large CSS files

You can tell the extension to automatically minimize
outputted CSS if you want
