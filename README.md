# Southern Paiute Talking Dictionary
## About
This project was created for the preservation of the Cedar Band dialect of the Southern Paiute language. This language has its roots in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. There are currently very few speakers left, so it is our intention to best preserve this language as we possibly can with the modern tools at our disposal.

Consequently, we are creating an online talking dictionary in order to 
1) preserve pronunciation of the Cedar Band dialect for future generations
2) make the Cedar Band dialect of Southern Paiute more accessible to band/tribal members and whomever wishes to access/learn the language. 

This repository holds all the (currently implemented) files to the online talking dictionary. The current designer and developer of the project is Ruth Reed. 

## Details of Application
Ideally, this application will be a search engine of sorts into a database for the Southern Paiute language. 

The application will include a home page from which you can search the database.

It will include words, phrases, and sentences.

All of the entries should have the word written in Southern Paiute, how it is written in the International Phonetic Alphabet, relevant grammatical information, the translation, an example (if applicable), related terms, and most importantly, an audio file. These audio files have been gathered over the last five years through language sessions with a tribal elder. It is our hope that, even if people can't read the Southern Paiute alphabet, they will still know how to pronounce the words due to these audio files. In addition, the inclusion of the audio should, to a certain extent, preserve the pronunciation of the language as it stands right now.

It will include an About page in which users can understand the background and purpose of the project.

It will also include a contact page in case the users wish to contact the team in charge of the project.

Since the inception and design of the project, two additional pages have been added. These are an alphabet page, to explain the alphabet this application uses, and an input page, so that an administrator can add relevant entries to the database. As of right now, there are no designs for these pages, but they will be added in the final product.
