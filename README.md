This project is for the preservation of the Cedar Band dialect of the Southern Paiute language. This language has its roots in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. There are currently very few speakers left, so it is our intention to best preserve this language as we possibly can with the modern tools at our disposal.

As a consequence, we are creating an online talking dictionary in order to 
1) preserve pronunciation of the Cedar Band dialect for future generations
2) make the Cedar Band dialect of Southern Paiute more accessible to band/tribal members and whomever wishes to access/learn the language. 

This repository holds all the files to the online talking dictionary. The current designer and developer of the project is Ruth Reed. 

This application is coded using HTML5, CSS3, vanilla Javascript, and Node.js.

NPM packages utilized:
- Express
- MongoDB
- Dotenv
- Cloudinary
